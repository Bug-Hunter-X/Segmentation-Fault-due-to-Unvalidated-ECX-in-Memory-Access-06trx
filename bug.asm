mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory using the EBX, ECX, and a displacement of 0x10.  The issue arises when ECX is too large and the resulting address falls outside of the allocated memory range, causing a segmentation fault.  This can happen easily if ECX is not properly validated before using this instruction.
